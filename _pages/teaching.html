Teaching provides a valuable opportunity to see how research and classroom practice inform one another.
For me, teaching is a varied role that involves supporting students as they engage with mathematical ideas,
encouraging curiosity, and being mindful of the affective factors that shape how students experience and learn mathematics.

As a graduate teaching assistant, I have had the opportunity to support a range of undergraduate mathematics courses,
working closely with students in a wide variety of tutorial formats.
