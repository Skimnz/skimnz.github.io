testing

<p>
I approach teaching as a space for learning, experimentation, and reflection, both for students and for myself as an educator.
Across my teaching roles, I have been particularly interested in how students engage with mathematical ideas in tutorials,
how collaborative activity shapes learning, and how teaching design can support sense-making in undergraduate mathematics.
</p>

<p>
As a graduate teaching assistant, I have had the opportunity to support a range of undergraduate mathematics courses,
working closely with students in tutorials and contributing to assessment, facilitation, and learning support.
These experiences have played an important role in shaping my teaching philosophy and research interests.
